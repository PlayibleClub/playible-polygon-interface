# Overview

Fantasy Investar will combine fantasy sports, NFT technology and Anchor Protocol, to make sports investing possible.

## Brief Description

Fantasy Investar will provide the 50+ million fantasy sports users around the world the ability to invest into athletes, sharing in their athletes’ success as they benefit from on-field performances. This will be achieved by allowing users to invest into NFT athlete tokens, providing users a sense of ownership of their athletes’ successes. We will be continually increasing the utility of these tokens to further enhance their value, as well as the engagement users will have with their chosen sport and athletes.

Our approach will integrate a fantasy sports scoring model to distribute rewards to the best performing athletes, as well as rewarding individual achievements \(MVP, ROTY etc\). Users will be able to use their tokens to form teams to compete in daily, weekly and seasonal challenges to win prize pools. Fantasy Investar will enable sports fans to become their own player scout, assessing prospects and investing early to sell for a profit as demand increases.
